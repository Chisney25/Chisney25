# Hi, I'm Miracle Chisom Ikechukwu! 👋 

### ⚙️ Engineering Logic | 🚀 Power Platform Architecture | 🛠 Cloud/DevOps Enthusiast

I am a **B.Eng. degree holder in Power and Machinery Engineering** currently bridging the gap between physical system optimization and digital automation. Based in **Wroclaw, Poland**, I architect scalable, logical workflows that solve real-world operational friction.

### 💡 Why Engineering & Power Platform?
In Power and Machinery Engineering, everything is about **Input → Logic → Output**. I apply this exact principle to the **Microsoft Power Platform**:
- **Process Mapping:** Treating business workflows like mechanical systems to identify and eliminate bottlenecks.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Using diagnostic engineering logic to troubleshoot complex Power Automate flows and log data.
- **Reliability:** Applying the precision of a 98% data accuracy standard to every digital solution I deploy.

### ♾️ DevOps & ALM Focus
I am currently specializing in the automation of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
- **Core Strategy:** [Enterprise Environment & Governance Framework](https://github.com/Chisney25/DevOps-Infrastructure-Lab/blob/main/environment-strategy.md)
- **Version Control:** Git-flow methodology for managing multi-environment deployments.
- **CI/CD Tools:** Exploring Azure DevOps Pipelines and GitHub Actions for automated solution exports.

## 🧪 Automated Quality Assurance
I use **GitHub Actions** to ensure my infrastructure code is high-quality:
- **Documentation Audits:** Ensures all strategy files include Security/RBAC keywords.
- **Bash Linting:** Automatically checks shell scripts for syntax errors before deployment.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Simulates script execution in a Linux (Ubuntu) environment.
