# Hi, I'm Miracle Chisom Ikechukwu! 👋 

### ⚙️ Engineering Logic | 🚀 Power Platform Architecture | 🛠 Cloud/DevOps Enthusiast

I am a **B.Eng. degree holder in Power and Machinery Engineering** currently bridging the gap between physical system optimization and digital automation. Based in **Wroclaw, Poland**, I architect scalable, logical workflows that solve real-world operational friction.

### 💡 Why Engineering & Power Platform?
In Power and Machinery Engineering, everything is about **Input → Logic → Output**. I apply this exact principle to the **Microsoft Power Platform**:
- **Process Mapping:** Treating business workflows like mechanical systems to identify and eliminate bottlenecks.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Using diagnostic engineering logic to troubleshoot complex Power Automate flows and log data.
- **Reliability:** Applying the precision of a 98% data accuracy standard to every digital solution I deploy.
